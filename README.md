  ###### <h3> Overview
 
This repository contains codes of a novel approach **gg3dhar** to categorize human actions collected by a Kinect sensor. The architecture is designed using layers of growing grid neural networks in a biologically inspired hierarchical cognitive framework. Three different datasets of actions are used to evaluate the performance of the system: [MSRAction3D dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/zliu/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fzliu%2Factionrecorsrc%2F), [Florence 3D actions dataset](https://www.micc.unifi.it/resources/datasets/florence-3d-actions-dataset/) and [UTKinect-Action3D Dataset](http://cvrc.ece.utexas.edu/KinectDatasets/HOJ3D.html). Anyone interested in using **gg3dhar** architecture and/or any of its components, please cite the following [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041720300243)/[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11165):
